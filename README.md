### To compile and verify the c code on the riscv compiler and verifying the number of lines in the assembly language code manually

### Materials and Tools
  - GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
  - RISC-V GNU Compiler Toolchain
  - Ubuntu OS

### Step 1:- Compiling the c code on the RISCV compiler

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int i,sum=0,n=57;
for(i=0;i<=n;i++)
{
sum+=i;
}
printf("The Sum of the numbers from 1 to %d is %d ",n ,sum);
return 0;
}
```

### Output:-

```plaintext
THe output of the code is 1653
```

## Screenshots of the compiled result

![riscv gcc ofast](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c7477dc-4667-434a-9ef0-8624b6362f36)

### Step 2:- Get the assembly language code for the given c file

### Once we get the assembly language code we then verify the number of addresses in the code by subtracting the address next to the last line of the code with the first address and dividing the same by 4 since 4 bytes of data is used by each address line

## Assignment 3
### Task 1:- 
To find the output of the C program on the RISC V Compiler using the Spike command and debug the code

### In assignment 1 we have compiled and found the output of the c code using the GCC compiler and have found the sum of the n numbers. In assignment 2 we have looked at the assembly code for the same using the objdump command on the RISC V compiler. In assignment 3 we are going to have find the result of the n numbers on the RISCV compiler using the SPIKE command

## Code for compiling the objdump file
```bash
spike pk sum1ton.o
```
### The compiled code using SPIKE command
![result from gcc compiler](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4184bd6a-8bc4-40ba-bc97-4c040b7c960a)

### The assembly code of O1
![assembly code](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5dc5673f-202b-4896-875c-78242dfb6dac)

### The assembly code of Ofast
![assembly code_ ofast](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c743439b-7dea-4e59-86fa-76a79cd51bd5)



## Code for debugging the assembly code obtained in assignment 2
```bash
spike -d pk sum1ton.o
```
### From the assembly code we can see that the first address is at 10184. In order to debug the code we need the program counter to point at this address location. Therefore we use the following command to place the program counter on the the location 10184.

```bash
until pc 0 10184
```
###Similarly we can apply the same logic for Ofast code

```bash
until pc 0 100bo
```

### The first instruction involves the stack pointer. Therefore in order to check the initial and final contents of the stack pointer we use the following code. [O1]

```bash
reg 0 sp
```
### The following are the initial contents of the stack pointer

![stack pointer contents](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15734fb6-4390-4a8a-8c46-3d208c517225)
### In the assembly code we can see that the value of the stack pointer is being reduced by 10 in hexadecimal we is equivalent to being reduced by 16 in decimal notation

### After running the first line of the code the contents of the stack pointer get modified and we get the follwoing result

![modified sp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03f6cb0c-2d06-42e1-a38c-36c63a921e6b)

### Similarly for the register a0 we observe the following initial and final contents [ O-fast]

```bash
reg 0 a0
```

![a0 initial contents](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2156c1c6-da00-4a39-8b49-b66eab93d527)

### Similarly we can do the same for all the other instructions in the code and find out the contents in the respective addressing locations and their updated values once we execute the lines in the debugger.

## Conclusion

The ISA used by us is not in accordance with the one which is used in the program. Therefore we can observe some discrepancies in the outputs of the instructions assigned to me and the original instructions which were designed with respect to a different ISA.

## Write a code for an Analog Comparator in C to compare the analog voltages

### * Step 1:- Open the leafpad editor and write the c code which is executable on gcc and risc v gcc

```bash
#include <stdio.h>

// Mock function to simulate analog read
int analogRead(int pin) {
    // In real application, this would interface with hardware ADC
    return pin * 100;  // Example value
}

int main() {
    int pinA = 3;
    int pinB = 4;
    int valueA, valueB;

    // Read analog inputs
    valueA = analogRead(pinA);
    valueB = analogRead(pinB);

    // Compare values
    if (valueA > valueB) {
        printf("Pin A has a higher voltage.\n");
    } else if (valueA < valueB) {
        printf("Pin B has a higher voltage.\n");
    } else {
        printf("Both pins have the same voltage.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```


![gcc image 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/318f4caf-6613-4bbe-b240-06e800ce4f6a)

### * Step 2:- Compile the above code using this command on the gcc compiler. 
```bash
gcc analogcomp.c
```
Here analogcomp is the name of my c program file

### * The output of the code is as follows:-

![gcc image 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6624c2b-8f71-458c-a35c-7c5980d18f3e)

### * Step 3:- Compile the above code on RISC V architecture for O1 and Ofast 

### For O1
 We run the following  command in order to compile the c code on risc v architecture for O1
```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o analogcomp.o analogcomp.c
```
 The output is as follows

![O1_output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e7f425a-eca4-4345-be0b-eaa863f3237b)

 We are only concerned with the corresponding assembly language program out of the output generated previously. In order to get the same we run the following code.

```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d analogcomp.o | less
```

The output is as follows and the number of instructions in the assembly code can be found out as follows:-

![main_function riscv o1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e14675c1-3f2e-4b5f-8efa-cfcbe255e138)

Here we can observe that the decimal value is 180. Also in the assembly language 1 line of code takes up 4 bytes of space in the memory therefore we can verify that the number of lines in the assembly language is 180/4 which is 45.

### For Ofast

We run the following  command in order to compile the c code on risc v architecture for O-fast
```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o analogcomp.o analogcomp.c
```
 The output is as follows
![ofast_output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8edebb7-752c-4e60-831c-4a3892fcca8e)


 We are only concerned with the corresponding assembly language program out of the output generated previously. In order to get the same we run the following code.
 
```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d analogcomp.o | less
```

The output is as follows and the number of instructions in the assembly code can be found out as follows:-

![ofast output_new](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0b098b3-f176-4a9b-b840-1b2e1de52e06)

Similar to O1 we can see that the decimal value of obtained is 36 which when divided by 4 gives us 9 which are the total number of addressing lines in our code.

### Result of the RISC V O1 and Ofast command

Code for compiling the objdump file
```bash
spike pk analogcomp.o
```

Result for O1

![Spike O1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ca600a6-10ed-4f2d-b5f3-2974dc064a94)

Result for Ofast

![Spike Ofast](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59dea6da-dccd-4713-b6e4-ad34c59a3826)

### Debegging the assembly code for O1 and Ofast

We use the following command for debugging the code

```bash
spike -d pk analogcomp.o
```
For O1 we have the following code

![debugger_o1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/550d7cbc-11a2-4440-abd0-216e5f5a9d09)

For Ofast we have the following code

![debugger_ofast](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5aa1081e-f8e7-439a-8792-b2becbc8ebc1)

While debugging we have found out the starting address and have initialised the program counter to this address. The first instruction for both O1 and Ofast involves the stack pointer so we have found out the starting address of the stack pointer. After the execution of that instruction we can observe that the address of the stack pointer is to be reduced by 32 in hexadecimal which is equivalent to 20 in decimal which is what we observe when the address of the stack pointer reduces from 50 to 30. Similarly we can do the same for the rest of the instructions.

### Conclusion

We have thereby verified the output of the analog comparator on the GCC and the RISC V GCC compilera and debugged the output using the spike command for both O1 and Ofast.

# Digital Logic with TL-Verilog and Makerchip

### Sequential Calculator

Calculators tend to remember the previous result and use it for the next operation. The sequential calculator does this and feeds back the output to the next input. The code for the same is as follows:-

```bash
\m5_TLV_version 1d: tl-x.org
\m5
   
   // =================================================
   // Welcome!  New to Makerchip? Try the "Learn" menu.
   // =================================================
   
   //use(m5-1.0)   /// uncomment to use M5 macro library.
\SV
   // Macro providing required top-level module definition, random
   // stimulus support, and Verilator config.
   m5_makerchip_module   // (Expanded in Nav-TLV pane.)
	
\TLV
   //$count[31:0] = 32'b0;
   
   // Sequential Clock
   
   |calc
      @1
         $clk_omkar = *clk;
         $reset = *reset;
         $val1[31:0] = >>1$result[31:0];
         $val2[31:0] = $rand2[3:0];
         $result[31:0] = $reset ? 32'b0 : ($sel[1:0] == 2'b00)
                         ? ($val1[31:0] + $val2[31:0]) : ($sel[1:0] == 2'b01)
                         ? ($val1[31:0] - $val2[31:0]) : ($sel[1:0] == 2'b10)
                         ? ($val1[31:0] * $val2[31:0]) : ($sel[1:0] == 2'b11)
                         ? ($val2[31:0] != 0 ? ($val1[31:0] / $val2[31:0]) : 32'bx) :  32'b0;
         //$count[31:0] = $reset  ? 0 : (>>1$count + 1);
   
   // Assert these to end simulation (before Makerchip cycle limit).
   *passed = *cyc_cnt > 40;
   *failed = 1'b0;
\SV
	endmodule;

```

This gives us the following waveforms and block diagram:-

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55434301-1098-4344-ae9f-2246f605a276)

### Pipelined Logic:-

Pipelining is used to maximise resource utilisation and thus reduce the delays in performing all the operations in a given task. In order to do so me make sure that every block in our system is working almost in every cycle such that it does not affect the operation of any other block which may be dependent or independent of its result. We have used a pythagorean calculator in our case. The code for the same is as follows.

```bash
\m5_TLV_version 1d: tl-x.org
\m5
   // =================================================
   // Welcome!  New to Makerchip? Try the "Learn" menu.
   // =================================================
   
   //use(m5-1.0)   /// uncomment to use M5 macro library.
\SV
	`include "sqrt32.v"
   // Macro providing required top-level module definition, random
   // stimulus support, and Verilator config.
   m5_makerchip_module   // (Expanded in Nav-TLV pane.)
\TLV
   |calc
      @1
         $reset = *reset;
         $clk_omkar = *clk;
      ?$valid
         @1
            $aa_sq[31:0] = $aa[3:0] * $aa[3:0];
            $bb_sq[31:0] = $bb[3:0] * $bb[3:0];
         @2
            $cc_sq[31:0] = $aa_sq + $bb_sq;
         @3
            $cc[31:0] = sqrt($cc_sq);
         //@4
         //$tot_dist[63:0] = $reset ? 0 : $valid ? (>>1$tot_dist + $cc) : >>1$tot_dist;
            
         //@4
         //$adder[31:0] = $cc + >>1$tot_dist;
         //@5
         //$tot_dist[31:0] = $valid ? ( >>1$tot_dist + $adder ) : >>1$tot_dist
   
   // Assert these to end simulation (before Makerchip cycle limit).
   *passed = *cyc_cnt > 16'd30;
   *failed = 1'b0;
\SV
   endmodule
```

The output for the following code is as follows:-

![Pipelined_logic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/291685cf-eb23-46ea-a894-68b6faf91deb)

### Cycle Calculator

In the sequential calculator we have taken the output of the previous result and fed it back to the next input but in this case we are using 3 stages of pipeline instead of 2 and therefore the calculator input will receive input which is 2 cycles older.

```bash

\m5_TLV_version 1d: tl-x.org
\m5
   
   // =================================================
   // Welcome!  New to Makerchip? Try the "Learn" menu.
   // =================================================
   
   //use(m5-1.0)   /// uncomment to use M5 macro library.
\SV
   // Macro providing required top-level module definition, random
   // stimulus support, and Verilator config.
   m5_makerchip_module   // (Expanded in Nav-TLV pane.)
\TLV
   //$count[31:0] = 32'b0;
   |calc
      @1
         $clk_omkar = *clk;
         $reset = *reset;
         $val1[31:0] = >>2$result[31:0];
         $val2[31:0] = $rand2[3:0];
         
      @2
         $valid = $reset ? 0 : (>>1$valid + 1);
         $out[31:0] = ($reset | !($valid)) ? 32'b0 : ($sel[1:0] == 2'b00) ? ($val1[31:0] + $val2[31:0]) : ($sel[1:0] == 2'b01) ? ($val1[31:0] - $val2[31:0]) : ($sel[1:0] == 2'b10) ? ($val1[31:0] * $val2[31:0]) : ($sel[1:0] == 2'b11) ? ($val2[31:0] != 0 ? ($val1[31:0] / $val2[31:0]) : 32'bx) :  32'b0;
         
   
   // Assert these to end simulation (before Makerchip cycle limit).
   *passed = *cyc_cnt > 40;
   *failed = 1'b0;
\SV
   endmodule

```

The output for the cycle calculator is as follows:-

### Validity

When we generate a waveform as in all the previous cases we are receiving a result for all the clock cycles. Here there are no compilation errors but it is quite possible that logical errors can be present in these cases. These errors will be ignored during compile time and it will be difficult to debug them by simply looking at the waveforms. Also there might be certain cases where a dont care condition comes up. These cases are insignificant to us and thus should be neglected . In order to do so we use the Validity. The global clock is also running all the time. There might be instances in our code when we do not need a particular case to run but still does as the clock triggers it. In order to execute a clock physically voltage or current sources are used. These sources use some power during that clock cycle. In complex circuits if such cases are ignored a lot of power will be wasted. So in order to reduce power consumption we remove the clock during such cycles and this process is called as clock gating. The validity helps us with this.

The code for Validity is as follows for the pythagorean calculator:-

```bash
\m5_TLV_version 1d: tl-x.org
\m5
   // =================================================
   // Welcome!  New to Makerchip? Try the "Learn" menu.

         $reset = *reset;
         $clk_omkar = *clk;

            $aa_sq[31:0] = $aa[3:0] * $aa[3:0];

         @2
            $cc_sq[31:0] = $aa_sq + $bb_sq;
         @3
            $cc[31:0] = sqrt($cc_sq);
            //@4
            //$tot_dist[63:0] = $reset ? 0 : $valid ? (>>1$tot_dist + $cc) : >>1$tot_dist;
            //@4
            //$adder[31:0] = $cc + >>1$tot_dist;

   // Assert these to end simulation (before Makerchip cycle limit).
   *passed = *cyc_cnt > 16'd30;
   *failed = 1'b0;
\SV
   endmodule
```

The output for the following code is as follows:-

# Basic RISC-V CPU microarchitecture

In this step we are designing the individual blocks of the microprocessor.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58c6a3f1-ba27-43a9-aff0-1fa285ff7a73)


  
### Program Counter

The program counter is supposed to increase its value by 4 to fetch the next instruction from the memory. The below image specifies the same. In case a reset is triggered the program counter will be initialised to zero for the next instruction.

The following diagram explains the working of the program counter

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72baefa6-30cb-4a22-8caa-b370954765bc)

The following is the code for the working of the program counter

```bash
$pc[31:0] = >>1$reset ? 0 : ( >>1$pc + 31'h4 );
```
We get the following output after executing the code:-

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9eef0a38-71d1-4fa4-bbf6-aa98283bc534)


### Adding the instruction memory

The program counter points to the next address where the instruction is present in the instruction memory. We need to fetch this instruction in order to process it and make further calculations.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/076a1cc9-81f8-4603-8612-394ddd2078fd)

```bash
$imem_rd_en = >>1$reset ? 0 : 1;
$imem_rd_addr[M4_IMEM_INDEX_CNT-1:0] = $pc[M4_IMEM_INDEX_CNT+1:2];
$instr[31:0] = $imem_rd_data[31:0];
```

The output of the following code is as follows:-

![Instruction_memory](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2339469d-dc31-486d-8be6-b943fbaa8a98)


### Decoding the instruction

We have decoded the instruction on the basis of all the 6 types of RISC V instruction set. The code for decoding is as follows:-

```bash
$is_i_instr = $instr[6:2] ==? 5'b0000x ||
              $instr[6:2] ==? 5'b001x0 ||
              $instr[6:2] ==? 5'b11001;
$is_r_instr = $instr[6:2] ==? 5'b01011 ||
              $instr[6:2] ==? 5'b011x0 ||
              $instr[6:2] ==? 5'b10100;
$is_s_instr = $instr[6:2] ==? 5'b0100x;
$is_b_instr = $instr[6:2] ==? 5'b11000;
$is_j_instr = $instr[6:2] ==? 5'b11011;
$is_u_instr = $instr[6:2] ==? 5'b0x101;
```

The output is as follows:-

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3504a8b-d0fc-4575-b5f7-fd0ddc3ca448)


### Immediate Decode Logic

The instruction sets have an immediate field. In order to decoder this field we use the following code:-

```bash
$imm[31:0] = $is_i_instr ? {{21{$instr[31]}}, $instr[30:20]} :
                      $is_s_instr ? {{21{$instr[31]}}, $instr[30:25], $instr[11:7]} :
                      $is_b_instr ? {{20{$instr[31]}}, $instr[7], $instr[30:25], $instr[11:8], 1'b0} :
                      $is_u_instr ? {$instr[31:12], 12'b0} :
                      $is_j_instr ? {{12{$instr[31]}}, $instr[19:12], $instr[20], $instr[30:21], 1'b0} :
                      32'b0;
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cebd84e6-f460-47ed-a6de-d3eb8f51a6fa)


### Decode logic for other fields

Apart from the immediate we have other fields which also need to be decoded. The code for the same is as follows:-

```bash
$rs2_valid = $is_r_instr || $is_s_instr || $is_b_instr;
         ?$rs2_valid
            $rs2[4:0] = $instr[24:20];
            
         $rs1_valid = $is_r_instr || $is_i_instr || $is_s_instr || $is_b_instr;
         ?$rs1_valid
            $rs1[4:0] = $instr[19:15];
         
         $funct3_valid = $is_r_instr || $is_i_instr || $is_s_instr || $is_b_instr;
         ?$funct3_valid
            $funct3[2:0] = $instr[14:12];
            
         $funct7_valid = $is_r_instr ;
         ?$funct7_valid
            $funct7[6:0] = $instr[31:25];
            
         $rd_valid = $is_r_instr || $is_i_instr || $is_u_instr || $is_j_instr;
         ?$rd_valid
            $rd[4:0] = $instr[11:7];
```
At a time only one instruction is passed on to for decode. This instruction can be of any 1 of the 6 instruction set types. Thus we need to validate that it belongs to the respective category or else there may be a clash of different instruction set types.

### Decoding Individual Instructions

We are decoding the individual instructions using the following code

```bash
$dec_bits [10:0] = {$funct7[5], $funct3, $opcode};
$is_beq = $dec_bits ==? 11'bx_000_1100011;
$is_bne = $dec_bits ==? 11'bx_001_1100011;
$is_blt = $dec_bits ==? 11'bx_100_1100011;
$is_bge = $dec_bits ==? 11'bx_101_1100011;
$is_bltu = $dec_bits ==? 11'bx_110_1100011;
$is_bgeu = $dec_bits ==? 11'bx_111_1100011;
$is_addi = $dec_bits ==? 11'bx_000_0010011;
$is_add = $dec_bits ==? 11'b0_000_0110011;
```
We also have to update the program counter

```bash
$pc[31:0] = >>1$reset ? 32'b0 :
>>1$taken_branch ? >>1$br_target_pc :
>>1$pc + 32'd4;
```

The output for the above code is as follows:-

### Register File Read and Enable

Here we read the instructions from the respective instruction memory and store it in the registers. We have 2 register slots the read the instructions from the memory. We send these stored instructions to the ALU after this process.

The code is as follows:-

```bash
$rf_rd_en1 = $rs1_valid;
$rf_rd_index1[4:0] = $rs1;
$rf_rd_en2 = $rs2_valid;
$rf_rd_index2[4:0] = $rs2;

$src1_value[31:0] = $rf_rd_data1;
$src2_value[31:0] = $rf_rd_data2;
```

The output for the code is as follows:-

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28ba722a-4320-4deb-a5a7-8c7ccaceecac)

### Arithmetic and Logic Unit

Used to perform arithmetic operations on the values stored in the registers. The code for the same is as follows:-

```bash
$result[31:0] = $is_addi ? $src1_value + $imm :
                $is_add ? $src1_value + $src2_value :
                32'bx ;
```

Here we have written code for the addi and add operation.

### Register File Write

Once the ALU performs the operations on the values stored in ther registers we may need to put these values back into these registers based. For this we use the register file write. We also have to make sure that we should not write into the register if the destination register is x0 as it is always meant to be 0. The code is as follows:-

```bash
$rf_wr_en = $rd_valid && $rd != 5'b0;
$rf_wr_index[4:0] = $rd;
$rf_wr_data[31:0] = $result;
```

### Branch instructions

Based on the control input we may need to jump to some different address after a particular instruction based on some condition generated during run-time. This is when we use the branch instructions. The code is as follows:-

```bash
$taken_branch = $is_beq ? ($src1_value == $src2_value):
	        $is_bne ? ($src1_value != $src2_value):
	        $is_blt ? (($src1_value < $src2_value) ^ ($src1_value[31] != $src2_value[31])):
	        $is_bge ? (($src1_value >= $src2_value) ^ ($src1_value[31] != $src2_value[31])):
                $is_bltu ? ($src1_value < $src2_value):
                $is_bgeu ? ($src1_value >= $src2_value):
	        1'b0;
$br_target_pc[31:0] = $pc +$imm;
```
The output is as follows:-

### Testbench
In order to check whether the code written is correct or not we verify it using the testbench for the 1st five cycles

```bash
*passed = |cpu/xreg[10]>>5$value == (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9) ;
```

Upon checking the log file we get the following result

# Pipelined RISC V CPU
We observe some interdependencies of the values on one another during the execution of the instructions. Thus incorrect data gets processed and we get logical errors in the code. In order to solve these problems we have increased the number of pipelined stages in the code.



Final Pipelined Output:-

We can observe the values in the different registers on the viz tab. The following image shows the 1st clock cycle. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04a4dd68-11b8-4dda-9d3f-f13f56d1fe31)

Just like the above cycle we can move across different clock cycles and see the updated results in the registers. In our code we are gradually adding the values from 1 to 9 and are observing the final output in the registers. It takes 53 cycles for the register r14 to get updated to the value 45.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d79de8b8-f708-42dd-b099-20182834f413)

The execution of the full code takes 58 cycles including the load and the store operations.

# Convert TLV to Verilog using Sandpiper and write a testbench and simulate using iverilog and gtkwave to view the output waveforms. Plot below signals from gtkwave

Firstly we need to add the sandpiper module and the other necessary packages as follows:-

```bash
 $ sudo apt install make python python3 python3-pip git iverilog gtkwave docker.io
 $ sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
 $ cd ~
 $ pip3 install pyyaml click sandpiper-saas
```

After this we need to clone the repo containing VSDBabySoC design files and testbench using the following commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manili/VSDBabySoC.git
```

We now need to convert the original TLV file to the verilog code with the help of the sandpiper package.

```bash
sandpiper-saas -i ./src/module/*.tlv -o rvmyth.v --bestsv --noline -p verilog --outdir ./src/module/
```

We now have the verilog code with us. We now need to run this verilog code along with the testbench and get the output using the following command.

```bash
iverilog -o output/pre_synth_sim.out -DPRE_SYNTH_SIM src/module/testbench.v -I src/include -I src/module
```

After this we need to generate the .vcd file which will be executed in the gtkwave platform to create the waveforms.

```bash
./pre_synth_sim.out
```

After creating the .vcd file now we run this file on gtkwave by using the below command 

```bash
gtkwave pre_synth_sim.out
```

I have executed all the above code as follows:-

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b9ed9cb-e517-4b01-982c-72987ae23b37)

Upon executing the gtkwave file We get the following waveform which is the addition of the numbers from 1 to 10
